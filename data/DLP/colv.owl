  <owl:Class rdf:about="#intentional-collective">
    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="&xsd;string">We use the presence and structure of a unifying plan in order to characterize kinds of collectives. A preliminary consideration is that plan unification can have two senses.The first one only takes into account the action schemas executed by the members, who do not necessarily interact in a 'global' way. In other words, the roles played by members cover the collective, because they are (dispositionally) played by each member.The second sense is richer, and assumes that the unifying (maximal) plan (d-)uses roles that characterize (are played by some members, and related between them in a typical way) the collective.The first sense of plan unification is applicable to a subclass of simple collectives that we call here 'simple-planned-collectives'.The second sense of plan unification applies to intentional collectives proper.An intentional collective can be said to act intentionally because its members act, and because it is unified by a plan that is conceived by some rational agent. Therefore, there is nothing special in a collective being intentional: it is just a matter of having a plan and agentive members playing its characterizing roles. What is special is the distinction between the diversified ways of acting collectively (see subclasses).</rdfs:comment>

The first one is the type of members (e.g. physical persons, boys, cows, left-handers, etc.). Types are used in traditional classifications. For example, biological collectives can be distinguished from social collectives, based on the (biological or social) properties ascribed to members.</rdfs:comment>
