For this reason, we postulate a so-called specific retroactive dependency (SRD), meaning that the creator of the description is willing to attribute the status of a scientific law to that description, despite it could not be present before the situation. R-SAT typically applies to explanations that are considered as well-founded in science (physical, social, or cognitive), reverse engineering, criminal investigation, etc. Consider that the actual validity of the explanation is not addressed by the description, but by external evaluation descriptions."],

It can be     understood as a reification of the 'satisfiability' relation of formal     semantics that holds between theories and models. A theory is reified as a description, thus acquiring a life-cycle: a theory     can be changed, versioned, discussed, issued, etc. 'Theory' can be a 'potential' theory in the sense that most conceptualizations     that could be formalized, could also be reified, e.g. plans, norms,     stories, projects, diagnoses, methods, etc. No position is taken on the     extensionality of descriptions. For example, if a theory is required to be     reified in fine detail, if it changes an axiom, it could be considered no     more the same theory. On the other hand, if theories are reified without such a strong assumption,     some axioms can be changed just like non-essential parts of physical     objects, with the theory preserving its identity.In case a theory is considered extensional, it might be considered a member of     a class of 'theory changing history'. The 'refines' relation provides this     possibility.A model is reified as a situation, thus a *class* of models that can satisfy a     theory is reified as a situation type (class). Situations can depend on     descriptions, but not vice-versa (constructivist stance). Components of     descriptions 'classify' entities of situations.There are at least three     satisfaction subrelations, and a lot of conditions can be stated for     allowing an automatic matching of satisfaction.

 ["a.k.a. support.A (usually physical) representation (p. endurant, p. perdurant, p. quality, p. region, or p. situation) realizes a non-physical object according to a system of rules.The main use of this relation is between information objects and the entities through which information objects are used and interpreted. E.g. a paper copy of the 1861 edition of Dante's Comedy, with Dore's illustrations, realizes the Comedy (as an information object).There is a sense in which any entity that realizes an IO also realizes an IO about itself.For example, a painting realizing information about a woman also realizes information about its own information. Of course, the converse of the previous axiom does not hold in general.For example, the information about a woman can be realized by entities different from that woman (as when referring to an absent woman). In other words, an entity (in a semiotic perspective) always realizes two information objects: one about itself, and another about something else.In the non-representation cases, the information objects are identical (an entity only realizes information about itself).Therefore entities, once they have a relevance in a society, can have semiotic properties. Even physical artifacts that are not built primarily for communicative purposes  e.g. a chair  can be considered as realizing some IO that expresses a design description (cf. system-design), and is about a context (situation) of use, fruition, or just affordance that satisfies the design."],

For example, a desire to start a relationship can become a goal if someone decides to take action (or lets someone else take it for her sake) to obtain it.\nA goal is different from anobjective, because the second one is independent from the cognitive state of a particular physical agent.\nIn practice, an agent (physical or social) may aim at realizing an objective even though the realizing situation conflicts with a goal-situation of the same agent.\nIn 'private' plans of a physical agent,  realizing situations usually coincide with goal-situations.\nDifferent cases occur with plans endorsed by social agents like organizations, institutions, etc., which are more clearly aimed at realizing objectives."],

 ["A composed (mediated) relation used here to make relations 'temporary': by adding it as a superrelation, the effect is that the two related endurants cannot be present at all the same time intervals, but are compresent at least at some time interval (see related axiom).In FOL, the same constraint can be stated directly by coreference.This workaround can be used to index time of relations that involve reciprocal dependency, but it cannot be used in general with relations involving multiple strata of reality. For example, _about_ relation can be temporally indexed, without involving that the time of the information object overlaps with the time of the entity the information is about (but this works for e.g. the _realizes_ relation between information objects and entities whatsoever). The different temporal constraints of about vs. expresses probably derive from the dependency of aboutness from conception (to be about x, an information object should also express a description d that is satisfied by a situation including x, then temporal overlapping of _about_ is true in virtue of d). On the other hand, even conceives cannot be indexed in this way, because overlapping does not hold between the time og the conceiving agent, and the conceived description (or situation)."],

In general, processes differ     from situations because they are not assumed to have a description from     which they depend. They can be sequenced by some course, but they do not     require a description as a unifying criterion. On the other hand, at any     time, one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which     a process of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes a     situation. Since the decision of designing an explicit description that     unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, application, etc.,     when aligning an ontology do DLP, there can be indecision on where to     align a process-oriented class. For example, in the WordNet alignment, we     have decided to put only some physical processes under 'process', e.g.     'organic process', in order to stress the social orientedness of DLP. But     whereas we need to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive     organic processes, these will be put under 'situation'. Similar     considerations are made for the other types of perdurants in DOLCE. A     different notion of event (dealing with change) is currently investigated     for further developments: being 'achievement', 'accomplishment', 'state',     'event', etc. can be also considered 'aspects' of processes or of parts of     them. For example, the same process 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley' can     be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought the current state     that e.g. we are trying to explain), as an achievement (the erosion     process as the result of a previous accomplishment), as a state (if we     collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as an     event (what has changed our focus from a state to another). In the erosion     case, we could have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another:     a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) condensation d) transition     (causality). If we want to consider all the aspects of a process together,     we need to postulate a unifying descriptive set of criteria (i.e. a     'description'), according to which that process is circumstantiated in a     'situation'. The different aspects will arise as a parts of a same situation."],

Agentive figures are not dependent on roles defined or used in the same descriptions they are defined or used, but they can act because they depute some powers to some of those roles. In other words, a figure classified by some agentive role can play that role because there are other roles in the descriptions that define or use the figure. Those roles classifies endurants that result to act for the figure. For example, an employee acts for an organization that deputes the role (e.g. turner) that classifies the employee. Simply put, a guy working as a turner at FIAT acts for (or on behalf of) FIAT. In complex figures, like organizations or companies, a total agency is possible when an endurant plays a delegate or representative role of the figure.

(2) two sets of temporal relations defined over perdurants which are adapted from Allen's temporal calculus, and of spatial relations that simplify the expression of places and locations from particulars to regions, and (3) the DnS (Descriptions and Situations) ontology, which provides a vocabulary to talk of reified (social) entities such as relations,  roles, contexts,  situations, parameters, etc. Appropriate  relations link DnS reifications to DOLCE-Lite non-reified  entities. The reification ontology of DnS includes a minimal vocabulary for action and process theory, following the main assumptions in situation and action theories, like Situation and Attitudes, BDI, etc. The backbone has a stratification, so that TemporalRelations, SpatialRelations, and Extended DnS all inherit the DOLCE-Lite ontology.      Based on that backbone, other wide-scoping  ontologies are provided: (4) ontology of information  objects, based on semiotics, which provides a vocabulary to talk of languages, expressions vs. meaning, logical vs. physical documents, reference, etc. (5) a well-developed ontology of plans and tasks, containing also a set of individual tasks that provide grounded primitives to specify process types: this is  the OWL port of a FOL version as presented in the Deliverable  D07 of the Metokis EU Project: http://metokis.salzburgresearch.at; (6) a preliminary ontology of functional participation relations, which provide a vocabulary for event-oriented relations encoded by linguistic verbs (in Western languages), like  'performs' or 'makes'; (7) an ontology for collections and collectives; (8) a set of common sense mappings, introduced to support a mapping to WordNet  (contained in another file).  Besides these basic extensions, which are currently exploited in several application  domains, and are actively under development, there are also some less developed ontologies, all bases on the backbone, but still at a preliminary and debatable stage. They are included here as placeholders, and are used by some applications, but they are not yet stable. *******Scope of DOLCE-Lite-Plus*******  The lite versions of DOLCE are simplified translations of DOLCE into various logical languages. They are maintained for several reasons:    1. allowing the implementation of DOLCE-based ontologies in languages that are less expressive than FOL. In particular, DOLCE-Lite does not make use of S5 modalities and of some temporally-indexed relations.   Modal operators are not heavily exploited in DOLCE, then the consequences are not very harmful for most uses.   Temporal indexing is partly supported by composing originally indexed relations with temporal location relations. Even this support is not provided for description logic versions of DOLCE-Lite like DAML+OIL, OWL-DL, etc. 2. allowing a description-logic-like naming policy for DOLCE signature. In many cases, different names are adopted for relations that have the same name but different arities in the FOL version, or for relations that have polymorphic domains  3. allowing extensions of DOLCE that do not have a detailed axiomatization yet, and modularizing them (placeholders) 4. taking benefit of the services of certain implemented languages -specially the classification services provided by  description logics- in order to support domain applications. The DLP ontology library is currently maintained in two languages: a dialect of KIF3.0 (PL), and DAML+OIL (and now OWL-DL). The first one contains a complete code for the library,  including theWordNet alignment modules. The second one  contains the library (according to available costructs of  DAML+OIL) without the WordNet code, since it is very simple and takes much space.  DLP+KIF is currently used in some applications that need deep inferences, which can only be provided by expressive, logic-programming-enabled languages. DLP+DAML is currently used in Semantic Web applications, for example in the Core Ontology for Services (COS).  The extensions to DOLCE presented in the library are work in progress, and although some of them have been tested in realistic applications, they should be taken cautiously from the viewpoint of rigorous formal ontology. The axioms for constraining the semantics of relations in DLP, which exist in the KIF or FOL versions, are not included into this OWL version, because a workaround is needed for representing relation axioms in OWL-DL, which increases beyond acceptability the time employed by a reasoner to check the ontologies. *********Updates can be downloaded from: http://dolce.semanticweb.org*********"

C-SAT typically applies to different views of existing situations, as for regulative descriptions (disclaimer: the situation can be already created by complying to the regulation, e.g executing it as a plan, but in this case there actually exists a plan that has the regulation as part), narratives, symbolic interpretations, etc."],

 ["Within stative occurrences, we distinguish between  states and processes according to homeomericity: sitting is classified as a state  but running is classified as a process, since there are (very short) temporal parts  of a running that are not themselves runnings.In general, states differ from situations because they are not assumed to have a description from which they depend. They can be sequenced by some course, but they do not require a description as a unifying criterion.On the other hand, at any time, one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which a state of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes a situation.Since the decision of designing an explicit description that unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, application, etc., when aligning an ontology do DLP, there can be indecision on where to align a state-oriented class. For example, in the WordNet alignment, we have decided to put only some physical states under 'state', e.g. 'turgor', in order to stress the social orientedness of DLP. But whereas we need to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive turgor states, these will be put under 'situation'.Similar considerations are made for the other types of perdurants in DOLCE.A different notion of event (dealing with change) is currently investigated for further developments: being 'achievement', 'accomplishment', 'state', 'event', etc. can be also considered 'aspects' of processes or of parts of them. For example, the same process 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley' can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought the current state that e.g. we are trying to explain), as an achievement (the erosion process as the result of a previous accomplishment), as a state (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as an event (what has changed our focus from a state to another).In the erosion case, we could have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) condensation d) transition (causality).If we want to consider all the aspects of a process together, we need to postulate a unifying descriptive set of criteria (i.e. a 'description'), according to which that process is circumstantiated in a 'situation'. The different aspects will arise as a parts of a same situation."],

A preliminary consideration is that plan unification can have two senses.The first one only takes into account the action schemas executed by the members, who do not necessarily interact in a 'global' way. In other words, the roles played by members cover the collective, because they are (dispositionally) played by each member.The second sense is richer, and assumes that the unifying (maximal) plan (d-)uses roles that characterize (are played by some members, and related between them in a typical way) the collective.The first sense of plan unification is applicable to a subclass of simple collectives that we call here 'simple-planned-collectives'.The second sense of plan unification applies to intentional collectives proper.An intentional collective can be said to act intentionally because its members act, and because it is unified by a plan that is conceived by some rational agent. Therefore, there is nothing special in a collective being intentional: it is just a matter of having a plan and agentive members playing its characterizing roles. What is special is the distinction between the diversified ways of acting collectively (see subclasses)."],

 ["A relation holding between non-physical objects and entities whatsoever (thus including non-physical objects themselves). An intuition for the references relation could be that a non-physical object adds  'information' to an entity. In fact, non-physical objects depend on a communication setting. In most cases, this is the characteristic relation that provides a unity criterion to objects, events, etc.  For example, cars are objects and not mere aggregates because there is a  project, a design, a social value, a functional structure, a  personal emotional structure, etc. attached to them. This attachment can be represented by means of 'non-physical objects' that 'reference' cars. The most obvious application is for situations, which do not exist without a description, although they still are extensional entities: a situation without a part is no more the same situation, but a situation is not a mere aggregate, since it has references to a description  as its unity criterion. Adding information to an entity can also be thought as an intentional solution to a holistic stance. Defenders of this view -within different frameworks- are  Kant, Brentano, Husserl, Gestalt psychologists, Merleau-Ponty ... References is distinguished according to the kinds of non-physical objects and referenced  ground entities: referencing between descriptions and situations is called 'SATISFIED-BY', while referencing between description components and situation components is called 'CLASSIFIES'. 'SETTING-FOR' is a referencing relation between situation and the entities in its setting (it was formerly a constitution relation, but since situation appear to be social objects from the DOLCE viewpoint, the constitution solution is no more applicable). 'EXPRESSES' is bound to information objects and the meaning (description of a representation or conceptualization) in which they are involved. 'REALIZED-BY' is bound to information objects and physical representations that are used to communicate them, etc. 'ABOUT' is bound to information objects and entities whatsoever (aboutness of intentionality)."],

 ["A generic attitude relation that holds between agent-driven roles or agentive figures and tasks. This is used here as a shortcut for saying that someone participates to some action with a plan in mind, and desiring it. An analytic account of this relation requires an explicit plan, and that the course be a goal inside that plan.The acronym 'bdi' in the name is for 'belief, desire, intention', a well known model of deliberation used in many agent architectures.The intuition goes to the deliberative agent as something that, provided it has the belief _p_, the desire to have _q_, and the intention to do _r_ in order to get _q_, then it is ready to deliberate an action.Here it is as a placeholder, wating for a more comprehensive ontological theory that takes into account not only BDI, but also the details of interacting, cooperative, competitive agents in the context of complex social and legal modalities of action.This is a simple summary of how BDI is usually understood and implemented in information systems:- According to Wooldridge and Jennings, strong agents can possess mental attitudes.- According to the BDI paradigm, the current state of entities and environment as perceived by the agent (preconditions) are the agent's beliefs.- Desires are some future states that an agent would like to be in. Desires are sometimes called goals.- Intentions are some commitment of an agent to achieve a goal by progressing along a particular future path that leads to the goal. Such path is sometimes called a plan. - One advantage with using intentions is that the effort associated with creating them needs not be repeated every time they are required. Intentions can be pre-computed and cached. Each intention can be tagged with a trigger describing some situation in which this intention should be accessed and applied.- In a typical BDI paradigm, deliberation is done through the selection of a goal, the selection of a plan that will be used to form an intention, the selection of an intention, and the execution of the selected intention. All these decisions are based on the beliefs the agent has about the current state of the environment. The process of selecting the plan is known as means-end reasoning."],

 ["A relation holding between non-physical objects and entities whatsoever (thus including non-physical objects themselves). An intuition for the references relation could be that a non-physical object adds 'information'  to an entity. In fact, non-physical objects depend on a communication setting. In most cases, this is the characteristic relation that provides  a unity criterion to objects, events, etc. For example, cars are objects and not mere aggregates because there is a project, a design, a social value, a functional structure, a personal emotional structure, etc. attached to them. This attachment can be represented by means of 'non-physical objects' that 'reference' cars. The most obvious application is for situations, which do not exist without a description, although they still are extensional entities: a situation without a part is no more the same situation, but a situation is not a mere aggregate, since it has references to a description as its unity criterion. Adding information to an entity can also be thought as an intentional solution to a holistic stance. Defenders of this view -within different frameworks- are Kant, Brentano, Husserl, Gestalt psychologists, Merleau-Ponty ... References is distinguished according to the kinds of non-physical objects and referenced ground entities: referencing between descriptions and situations is called 'SATISFIED-BY', while referencing between description components and situation components is called 'CLASSIFIES'. 'SETTING-FOR' is a referencing relation between a situation and the entities in its setting (it was formerly a constitution relation, but since situation appear to be social objects from the DOLCE viewpoint, the constitution solution is no more applicable). 'EXPRESSES' is bound to information objects and the meaning (description of a representation or conceptualization) in which they are involved. 'REALIZED-BY' is bound to information objects and physical representations that are used to communicate them, etc. 'ABOUT' is bound to information objects and entities whatsoever (aboutness of intentionality)."],

As a matter of fact, no easy definition of artifactual properties is possible, hence it is better to rely on alternative descriptions and roles: a physical object that shows or is known to have an artifactual origin that counts in the tasks an ontology is supposed to support, will be a material artifact. On the other hand, physical objects that do not show that origin, or that origin is unimportant for the task of the ontology, will be physical bodies. Formally, a restriction is provided here that requires that the collection whose members are proper parts of a physical body is not *unified* by a plan or project. BTW, a physical body can still be a *device*, can be 'used' and have 'functions' (roles), e.g. a stone used as a weapon, but it plays no role like being produced, as material artifacts do. Moreover, a collection whose members are proper parts of a physical body can still be unified by a description (e.g. a biochemical model). Physical bodies can have several granularity levels: geological, chemical, physical, biological, etc."],

 ["An occurrence-type is stative or eventive according  to whether it holds of the mereological sum of two of its instances, i.e. if it is cumulative or not. A sitting occurrence is stative since the sum of two sittings is still a sitting occurrence.In general, events differ from situations because they are not assumed to have a description from which they depend. They can be sequenced by some course, but they do not require a description as a unifying criterion.On the other hand, at any time, one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which an event of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes a situation.Since the decision of designing an explicit description that unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, application, etc., when aligning an ontology do DLP, there can be indecision on where to align an event-oriented class. For example, in the WordNet alignment, we have decided to put only some physical events under 'event', e.g. 'discharge', in order to stress the social orientedness of DLP. But whereas we need to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive discharge events, these will be put under 'situation'.Similar considerations are made for the other types of perdurants in DOLCE.A different notion of event (dealing with change) is currently investigated for further developments: being 'achievement', 'accomplishment', 'state', 'event', etc. can be also considered 'aspects' of processes or of parts of them. For example, the same process 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley' can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought the current state that e.g. we are trying to explain), as an achievement (the erosion process as the result of a previous accomplishment), as a state (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as an event (what has changed our focus from a state to another).In the erosion case, we could have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) condensation d) transition (causality).If we want to consider all the aspects of a process together, we need to postulate a unifying descriptive set of criteria (i.e. a 'description'), according to which that process is circumstantiated in a 'situation'. The different aspects will arise as a parts of a same situation."],

For example, a surgical guideline describes how to carry out a heart transplant:  its (expected) execution situation is constituted by the perdurants, endurants,  and regions described by the guideline, while its pre-condition situation might be  only constituted by the heart to be removed, the one to be transplanted, their  anatomical and morphological environment, the physiological functions in which they  participates, and some physiological values.  But the devices used during the transplantation and the surgeon might (or might not) be external to the pre-condition situation.  This definition does not cover the possibility of a pre-condition having constituents that are not involved in the description. This is a difficult issue. A possible solution is that such pre-conditions are actually referenced by other descriptions that -for instance- 'control' the feasibility of a procedure, or 'analyze' a set of events under an independent unity criterion.

In both cases, these parts are occurrences themselves. We assume that objects cannot be parts of occurrences, but rather they participate in them. Perdurants extend in time by accumulating different temporal parts, so that, at any time they are present, they are only partially present, in  the sense that some of their proper temporal parts (e.g., their previous or future phases) may be not present. E.g., the piece of paper you are reading now is wholly present, while some temporal parts of your reading are not present yet, or any more. Philosophers say that endurants are entities that are in time, while lacking temporal parts (so to speak, all their parts flow with them in time).
