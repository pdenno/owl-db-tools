  ["A composed (mediated) relation used here to make relations 'temporary': by adding it as a superrelation, the effect is that the two related endurants cannot be present at all the same time intervals, but are compresent at least at some time interval (see related axiom).In FOL, the same constraint can be stated directly by coreference.This workaround can be used to index time of relations that involve reciprocal dependency, but it cannot be used in general with relations involving multiple strata of reality. For example, _about_ relation can be temporally indexed, without involving that the time of the information object overlaps with the time of the entity the information is about (but this works for e.g. the _realizes_ relation between information objects and entities whatsoever). The different temporal constraints of about vs. expresses probably derive from the dependency of aboutness from conception (to be about x, an information object should also express a description d that is satisfied by a situation including x, then temporal overlapping of _about_ is true in virtue of d). On the other hand, even conceives cannot be indexed in this way, because overlapping does not hold between the time og the conceiving agent, and the conceived description (or situation)."],

  ["Within stative occurrences, we distinguish between states and processes     according to homeomericity: sitting is classified as a state but running     is classified as a process, since there are (very short) temporal parts of     a running that are not themselves runnings. In general, processes differ     from situations because they are not assumed to have a description from     which they depend. They can be sequenced by some course, but they do not     require a description as a unifying criterion. On the other hand, at any     time, one can conceive a description that asserts the constraints by which     a process of a certian type is such, and in this case, it becomes a     situation. Since the decision of designing an explicit description that     unifies a perdurant depends on context, task, interest, application, etc.,     when aligning an ontology do DLP, there can be indecision on where to     align a process-oriented class. For example, in the WordNet alignment, we     have decided to put only some physical processes under 'process', e.g.     'organic process', in order to stress the social orientedness of DLP. But     whereas we need to talk explicitly of the criteria by which we conceive     organic processes, these will be put under 'situation'. Similar     considerations are made for the other types of perdurants in DOLCE. A     different notion of event (dealing with change) is currently investigated     for further developments: being 'achievement', 'accomplishment', 'state',     'event', etc. can be also considered 'aspects' of processes or of parts of     them. For example, the same process 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley' can     be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought the current state     that e.g. we are trying to explain), as an achievement (the erosion     process as the result of a previous accomplishment), as a state (if we     collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as an     event (what has changed our focus from a state to another). In the erosion     case, we could have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another:     a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) condensation d) transition     (causality). If we want to consider all the aspects of a process together,     we need to postulate a unifying descriptive set of criteria (i.e. a     'description'), according to which that process is circumstantiated in a     'situation'. The different aspects will arise as a parts of a same situation."],

In both cases, these parts are occurrences themselves. We assume that objects cannot be parts of occurrences, but rather they participate in them. Perdurants extend in time by accumulating different temporal parts, so that, at any time they are present, they are only partially present, in  the sense that some of their proper temporal parts (e.g., their previous or future phases) may be not present. E.g., the piece of paper you are reading now is wholly present, while some temporal parts of your reading are not present yet, or any more. Philosophers say that endurants are entities that are in time, while lacking temporal parts (so to speak, all their parts flow with them in time).
